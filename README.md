# AutinCodesBridge

## Description
This is a desktop application to play bridge with a 52 card deck. The application was written in Python using the PySimpleGUI library to create the desktop GUI. The game runs with the user in the declarer position and their partner in the dummy position. 

See the following Wikipedia article if you need an explanation for bridge: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge)

Currently the application only supports trick-taking, not bidding, although I may consider adding bidding at a later date. 

Here is what the application looks like in action:

## Motivation
In my elementary school's gifted program, there was a unit to teach students how to play contract bridge. Bridge is an intellectually stimulating card game, especially when played competitively, and the unit had the end goal of readying students to compete in a youth tournament hosted by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL). See [https://www.acbl.org/](https://www.acbl.org/) for more information on the ACBL. 

I enjoyed learning and playing bridge but didn't think I was an exceptional player. I was surprised, then, when my bridge partner and I won the tournament at the end of the unit. I returned to the tournament yearly until I was 16 or so, placing first or second each year I participated. I thought I might be good at this game after all. 

My enthusiasm for the game didn't last, unfortunately. As a teenager in high school, I found the culture surrounding adult bridge a little disagreeable for a couple reasons. First, there were very few players in adult bridge tournaments who were near my age. Second, adult partners were much more critical or condescending about mistakes I made while playing. Adult tournaments were more competitive than the youth tournaments, so I also wasn't winning like I had been before. I gave it a couple attempts after I'd aged out of the youth tournaments, but with my enthusiasm dwindling and my performance taking a hit, I decided to let bridge go. 

I took up bridge casually again in college while playing with friends--I taught the game to them one night while hanging out, playing cards. I'd tired of the card games that were luck based and wanted something where I had to think more, like bridge.

Since then, I've become interested in bridge again, and I decided that I'd make a bridge app to practice without the stress of a competitive environment or teach the game to a new group of friends. I needed a project to practice building a GUI in Python with, too, and so AustinCodesBridge was born. 

## Quick Start 
The quickest way to start the app is to clone the GitHub repository and run the main.py file from a command line. You'll need Python installed on your machine.

> git clone https://github.com/Austin-Buchanan/AustinCodesBridge

> py main.py
